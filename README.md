Scoring and Cleaning the Beverages Questionnaire

This is an example of how you can clean and score the data that comes from the [Beverage Intake Questionnaire (BEVQ-15)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3379009/figure/F1/). More information about the questionnaire [here](https://snaped.fns.usda.gov/library/materials/beverage-intake-questionnaire-bevq-15).

**Note:** In our example, we included 3 "other" slots for people to enter other drinks not included in the bevq-15.
