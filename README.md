Scoring and Cleaning the Beverages Questionnaire

This is an example of how you can clean and score the data that comes from the [Beverage Intake Questionnaire (BEVQ-15)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3379009/figure/F1/). More information about the questionnaire [here](https://snaped.fns.usda.gov/library/materials/beverage-intake-questionnaire-bevq-15).

**Note:** In our example, 3 alcoholic beverage items were not included because of the particular target population. If you should need these items, you will need to adjust your coding/labels, etc. See Excel file with each beverage label.
